  Add rule of 5 to all
  Make destructors virtual
  Create rule-of-five-default implementations
  Make sure all tests pass
  clang-format all

NOTE: 
  Rule-of-five-default:
    If you define, =default or =delete any of dtor, copy ctor, assignment op, move ctor, move assignment op then you must define, =default or =delete them all.

  Rule-of-zero:
    Use value semantics of stl and smart pointers to ensure you don't have to define any of the copy ctor, move ctor, assignment op, move assignment op, or dtor.

  Rule-of-five:
    If you define any of the copy ctor, move ctor, assignment op, move assignment op, or dtor, you must to all five.

  Rule-of-three:
    If you define any of the copy ctor, assignment op, or dtor, you must to all three.
